## üèÅ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:
-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18 or later recommended)
-   [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
-   [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd eventide-party-planner
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    This project uses Bun for package management.
    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

To start the development server, which runs both the Vite frontend and the Cloudflare Worker backend concurrently, run:

```bash
bun run dev
```

This will start the application on `http://localhost:3000` (or the next available port). The Vite server will handle hot module replacement for the frontend, and changes to the worker code will also be reloaded automatically.

## üöÄ Deployment

This application is designed to be deployed to the Cloudflare network.

1.  **Login to Wrangler:**
    If you haven't already, authenticate Wrangler with your Cloudflare account.
    ```bash
    wrangler login
    ```

2.  **Deploy the application:**
    Run the deploy script to build the application and deploy it to your Cloudflare account.
    ```bash
    bun run deploy
    ```

Wrangler will handle the process of building the frontend assets, bundling the worker, and deploying everything. You will be provided with a URL for your deployed application.

Alternatively, you can deploy directly from your GitHub repository.

## üìÇ Project Structure

The project is organized into three main directories:

-   `src/`: Contains all the frontend React application code, including pages, components, stores (Zustand), and utility functions.
-   `worker/`: Contains the backend Hono application code that runs on Cloudflare Workers, including API routes and entity logic for Durable Objects.
-   `shared/`: Contains TypeScript types and interfaces that are shared between the frontend and backend to ensure type safety across the stack.
